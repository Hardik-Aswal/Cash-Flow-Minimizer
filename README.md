# Cash-Flow-Minimizer
A DSA project based on (Graphs/Multisets/Heaps)
Cash flow is the net balance of cash moving into or out of business at a specific time.
An application cash flow minimizer can be built using Graphs concepts to minimize this cash flow.
For example, Assume three friends: friend one, friend two, and friend three. Friend one has to give 4k to friend three and 2k to friend one.
And friend two has to give 3k to friend three. Now minimize the flow between friend one and friend two by direct payment to friend three by friend one.
An application can be created with the same mechanism for translation
